# Needs Assessment Survey

In the process of developing the [Data Science and Software Services (DS3)][ds3-website] at NYU,
a needs assessment survey was sent to the researchers throughout the University.
This survey was supported by [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment (MSDSE)][msdse-website],
and in the spirit of the MSDSE we are making the materials available to aid other Universities 
in doing something similar.

This repository contains:

 * A survey for a needs assessment survey for Statistical Methodology and Software Services
   in the [Qualtrics][qualtrics-website] QSF format.
 * [Synthetic data][path-data-raw] for the Needs Assessment Survey of University researchers' needs on
   statistical methodology and software engineering services.
 * The [sample code][path-scripts] to generate the [sample report][path-report] based on the synthetic data.
