# Needs Assessment Survey and analysis scripts

In the process of developing the [Data Science and Software Services (DS3)](https://cds.nyu.edu/ds3/) at NYU, a needs assessment survey was sent to the researchers throughout the University. This survey was supported by the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment (MSDSE)](http://msdse.org), and in the spirit of the MSDSE we are making the materials available to aid other Universities in doing something similar.

This repository contains:

 * A survey for a needs assessment survey for Statistical Methodology and Software Services in the [Qualtrics QSF format](https://www.qualtrics.com). 
 * [synthetic data](Data/Raw/) for the Needs Assessment Survey of Univerisity researchers' needs on statistical methodology and software engineering services, 
 * and the sample code in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to generate the [sample report](Scripts/3-Short-Summary-DECOY.pdf) based on the synthetic data.
